## Abstract

Microwave imaging (MWI) is a promising non-invasive technique for quantitatively reconstructing the complex permittivity of biological tissues. However, its clinical application is often limited by the non-linear and ill-posed nature of the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem. To address this challenge, we propose CDL-Net, a deep learning-based dual-branch network. The real-valued branch, leveraging a ResNet50 backbone and an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module, extracts multi-scale semantic features. Concurrently, the complex-valued branch processes phase information directly, preserving crucial physical properties consistent with wave propagation in lossy media. Our experiments, conducted on a realistic 3D human thigh phantom, demonstrate that CDL-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding a PSNR of 48.331 dB and an SSIM of 0.997.

## Dataset

The data used in this project is generated by CST Studio Suite simulations. For a quick start, a small sample of the dataset is provided in the `sample_data/` folder. All training scripts are configured to read from this path by default.

The full dataset can be downloaded from [Your Dataset Download Link Here].

---

## Training

All training scripts are located in the `COMPARE/` folder. To train our proposed CDL-Net model, run:
```bash
python COMPARE/CDL_ASPP.py 
```
During training, model checkpoints and logs will be automatically saved in a newly created directory: `output/CDL_ASPP/`.

## Pre-trained Models

We provide the weights for the best-performing model trained on the CST thigh phantom dataset.

## Abstract

Microwave imaging (MWI) is a promising non-invasive technique for quantitatively reconstructing the complex permittivity of biological tissues. However, its clinical application is often limited by the non-linear and ill-posed nature of the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem. To address this challenge, we propose CDL-Net, a deep learning-based dual-branch network. The real-valued branch, leveraging a ResNet50 backbone and an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module, extracts multi-scale semantic features. Concurrently, the complex-valued branch processes phase information directly, preserving crucial physical properties consistent with wave propagation in lossy media. Our experiments, conducted on a realistic 3D human thigh phantom, demonstrate that CDL-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding a PSNR of 48.331 dB and an SSIM of 0.997.

## Setup

1.  **Clone this repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/molemolechuchuo/Deeplab_complexnet.git
    cd Deeplab_complexnet
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies** (Conda is recommended)

    ```bash
    conda create -n cdlnet python=3.9
    conda activate cdlnet
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```

3.  **Dataset**
    The dataset used in this project is generated by CST Studio Suite simulations and is located in the `EMTData/` folder. Please ensure the data path is consistent with the configuration in the scripts.

## Training

All training scripts are located in the `COMPARE/` folder. To train our CDL-Net model, run:

```bash
python COMPARE/CDL_ASPP.py 
```

During training, model checkpoints and logs will be automatically saved in the `ComplexNetDeepLab_Reg_Output/` folder.

## Pre-trained Models

We provide the best model trained on the CST thigh phantom dataset. You can download it from this repository at `ComplexNetDeepLab_Reg_Output/ComplexNetDeepLab_Reg_best_model.pth`.
